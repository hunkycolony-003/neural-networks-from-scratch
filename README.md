# neural-networks-from-scratch

This project implements Neural networks from scratch for handwritten digit recognition, trained using MNIST dataset. Furthuremore, it

- Uses only numpy as external library.
- Implements Stochastic Gradient Descent and mini-batches.
- Allows both constant and scheduled learning rates.

The resource used here is this Book of [Neural Networks Deep and learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html).
